# **Git workflow**
## What is Git workflow
* Git workflow allocates separate branches for functional development, release preparation, and maintenance,making the release iteration process smoother.
* Git workflow defines a strict branching model around project releases and assigns a very specific role to different branches instead of using concepts and commands that go beyond the functional branch workflow.
## Working manner of Git workflow
*  The Gitflow workflow still uses the central repository as the interaction center for all developers. Like other workflows, developers work locally and push branches to the central repository
## Some branches of Git workflow
* Master branches
* Develop branches
* Feature branches
* Release branches 
* Hot fix branches
## The advantages of Git workflow
* A robust framework for managing large projects.
* Pull Requests.
* Isolation of experimental development.
* More efficient collaboration.
